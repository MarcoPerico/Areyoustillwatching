            The streaming world has dramatically expanded over the past few
            years. Competition among video streaming platforms has become more
            and more fierce, as they long for users’ attention. Meeting
            everyone’s needs and tastes seems to be the right way to maintain
            dominance. “Decision fatigue” is one of the worst threats to these
            services’ success: the task of choosing something to watch can be a
            tortuous process. It can overwhelm users and discourage them if they
            are unable to find something interesting within a short time. In
            response to these challenges, streaming platforms have been
            implementing their interfaces with various strategies, ranging from
            autoplaying video trailers to providing user-tailored
            recommendations.

            The research behind the project comes from
            <i>Are You Still Watching?</i>, a printed report about the topic,
            realized in a previous phase of the course. The investigation was
            conducted on four main video streaming platforms: Netflix, Prime
            Video, YouTube and Twitch. These four were selected because they
            represent various types of video providers that, when compared,
            present differences and similarities in terms of content fruition.
            The research was centered around two seperate moments of the user
            experience on streaming platforms: the process of selecting what to
            watch and the actual fruition of content. The aspects analyzed range
            from the way of presenting the content library for both active
            (through the search bar) and passive (from the homepage) search
            experiences, to the ways of dealing with decision fatigue, with a
            general focus on the strategic or manipulative features implemented
            in the interfaces.

            When building the website, three of the findings from the report
            were selected to be representative of the research.<br />
            Finding new ways to present the findings from the report making them
            suitable for the web was a central part of the website design
            process. Each data visualization has been re-designed into an
            interactive web experience to allow users to directly experience the
            process of interface deconstructing and how data has been
            collected.<br />
            In order to test the search feature of each platform, the results
            pages were analysed both logged in with an account and without one,
            for two different search queries: a specific keyword, in this case
            “Akira”, and an arbitrary one, formed by completely random letters.
            By doing this, it is possible to observe how the different
            platforms’ algorithms react to the user’s search, either with a
            standard common search or without it having a clue of what the user
            is looking for. When the user is involved in an active research for
            content, it might be inferred that they don’t need to be shown
            recommendations since they already know what they want, but in fact
            algorithms do not take a step back.<br />
            What is observable is that not only do streaming platforms strive to
            satisfy your searches with pertinent results, but they also tend to
            create interest in content that you were not actually looking for:
            the algorithm makes sure you always have many options to pick from,
            it can rearrange results in an order that favours exclusive or
            original produced content and ultimately it will often propose
            results that have actually no relation to your typed-in query.
            Testing the same searches as a logged-off visitor was useful to
            analyse how platforms use personalization to make sure your hunt for
            content never fails, by adding personalized results that being
            logged-off simply don’t show or in other cases by displaying a
            larger amount of results to a new non-registered user to likely aim
            at creating interest in joining the service.
