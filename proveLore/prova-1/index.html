          Over the last five years, the world of streaming has exploded. As they
          compete for users' attention, video streaming platforms have gotten
          increasingly competitive.<br />
          One of the most serious challenges to these services' viability is
          <i>"decision fatigue"</i>, in which the act of selecting something to
          watch can overwhelm and discourage viewers if they are unable to
          discover something fascinating in a reasonable amount of time. As a
          result of this problem, streaming platforms have used a variety of
          ways to develop their user interfaces.<br />

          <i>Netflix</i>, <i>Prime Video</i>, <i>YouTube</i> and <i>Twitch</i>.
